        <h1>About Events In JS</h1>
        <p>Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can respond to them. In JavaScript, events are used to trigger functions when certain actions occur, such as user interactions (clicks, key presses), page loading, or form submissions.</p>
